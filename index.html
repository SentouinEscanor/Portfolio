                <p>This project focused on the development of a dynamic Used Cars Sales Portal, catering to two main user types: Users and Administrators.</p>
                <p>Users could seamlessly register and log in to the portal, post cars for sale with images, update their profiles, and participate in the bidding process. On the other hand, Administrators had functionalities to manage user registrations, update/delete car listings, and maintain their profiles.</p>
                <p>The portal also included features such as a comprehensive car listing view, search functionality by Make, Model, Registration Year, and Price Range, as well as About Us and Contact Us pages.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project, a Risk-Based Testing (RBT) approach was adopted to ensure thorough testing while prioritizing security. The RBT strategy encompassed different test stages including Integration, System, User Acceptance, Nonfunctional, Performance, and Security Testing. Each test cycle was informed by a test risk matrix that evaluated risk magnitude and impact.</p>
                <p>As a result, the project achieved optimized test coverage and early defect detection, contributing to a robust and secure Used Cars Sales Portal.</p>

            <div class="project-details">
                <p>As an independent systems analyst, I collaborated with a significant retail client facing challenges in stock management, re-ordering, and despatch processing. The client sought a streamlined solution for improved efficiency.</p>
                <p>Phase 1 commenced with information sharing and gathering. To facilitate this, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of traditional and agile systems analysis methodologies. This evaluation provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.</p>
                <p>Fact-finding investigations involved employing various techniques, including document analysis, personnel interviews, observations, and surveys. These methods informed a feasibility study that covered both business and technical aspects. The feasibility report not only assessed the relevance of criteria but also critically evaluated the feasibility study's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                <p>Following the feasibility study, the client gained clarity through a presentation on traditional and agile methodologies. A short report analyzing the client's system using a suitable methodology was produced, evaluating its effectiveness in the context of the business problem.</p>
                <p>For the final project element, a new system design was created, meticulously aligning with user and system requirements. The system design was formulated using robust systems analysis tools and techniques, effectively addressing the client's needs. The choice of methodology was justified, considering the client's business problem and projected expansion within 6-8 months.</p>
                <p>This project showcases a holistic approach to systems analysis, encompassing methodology evaluation, feasibility studies, and meticulous system design. It underscores my ability to provide tailored solutions that meet both current and future client needs.</p>
